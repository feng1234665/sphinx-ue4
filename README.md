# Sphinx-UE4
Sphinx-UE4 is a speech recognition plugin for Unreal Engine 4. 
The plugin makes use of the Pocketsphinx library.

<b>Note:</b> 
This plugin uses a slightly modified version of PocketSphinx, to support passing in a set of keywords, dynamically.
The modified code is contained within the _other folder.
